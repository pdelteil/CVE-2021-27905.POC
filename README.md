# CVE-2021-27905.POC
POC for LFI related to CVE-2021-27905

POC for [apache-solr-file-read nuclei template](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/master/vulnerabilities/apache/apache-solr-file-read.yaml)

# Use 

`traverse.sh path`

For example, using /root as path, will display the content of all files (recursively) 

`> ./traverse.sh /root ` 

It's also possible to traverse and get the content of every file on the server (with reading privileges obviously) 

`> ./traverse.sh / `
